# Uber analysis
___

This analysis provides a comprehensive view of Uber’s operational performance by uncovering key patterns in booking demand, cancellations, and revenue generation across vehicle types and pickup/drop-off locations. 
By transforming raw trip data into clear, interactive insights, it highlights where demand is strongest, which factors drive cancellations, and how different vehicle categories contribute to overall revenue. 
This project also includes a dashboard designed to support data-driven decision-making. The analysis enables stakeholders to quickly identify opportunities to optimize fleet allocation, improve customer experience, and maximize revenue across regions—setting the stage for deeper exploration and strategic action.
